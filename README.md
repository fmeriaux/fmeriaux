## 👋 Hi there 

### 👨‍💻 Software Architect and Tech Lead

I am a software architect, and I currently hold the position of Tech Lead at Leroy Merlin (ADEO).

### 🚀 Passion for Science and New Technologies

I am passionate about science and new technologies. I strive to solve problems with tailored solutions, leveraging my knowledge and experience. I also enjoy learning from more experienced people and sharing my own experiences with others.

### 🌍 Contributing to Open Source

When I find time, I try to contribute to open source! It's a great way to give back to the community and learn from other developers.

### 🕹️ Balancing Work and Play

Sometimes video games kidnap me, when it's not my BAE! 😅 In my downtime, I enjoy playing video games to unwind, but I always make sure to balance it with my other interests and responsibilities.

### 🧘 Mindfulness and Personal Growth

I also practice meditation regularly to cultivate mindfulness and focus. Additionally, I prioritize personal growth and strive to make a positive impact in my personal and professional life.
